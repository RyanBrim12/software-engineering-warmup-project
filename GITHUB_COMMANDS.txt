Go to folder where you want to save project.

# Add project by cloning:

git clone https://github.com/RyanBrim12/software-engineering-warmup-project.git

#Always Pull from Repo first to make sure the project is up-to-date, before pushing so no merge conflicts:

git pull


# Add file you want were working on:

git add query.py

# Add commit message of what you did:

git commit -m "I fixed the function..."

# Push the file to the git repo, with the branch you're on:

git push origin main

# If a merge conflict happens pull again and try from there!
